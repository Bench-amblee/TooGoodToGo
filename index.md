## Hello!

### My name is Ben    
This is my cover letter for Too Good To Go, a company that I would absolutely love to work at! Your mission of taking action against food waste is one that really resonates with me.

I learned about Too Good To Go after meeting one of the ambassadors in Austin, TX. I've been working in food service since I was 16 and have always hated how much food those businesses throw away. My solution was to just take food home or give it away to my friends instead of throwing it out, unfortunately this solution isn't very scalable. When I learned about what Too Good To Go was trying to do I logged on to LinkedIn and immediately starting looking at open positions - I love what you're trying to do and would love to be a part of it.

I believe my background in geographic information systems along with my current experience in Python and data science would make me a great fit for either the Analytics Engineer or BI Developer position - wherever I could help the most. The only issue is I'm currently located in the US and, unfortunately, don't think I will be able to relocate to Denmark. 

I know Too Good To Go has a headquarters in New York as well and I would be happy to relocate there if that is an option. I believe these roles would the perfect way for me to contribute and if you give me the chance to work remotely or in one of the US headquarters, I will make it work. Luckily I have experience working remotely with a team across multiple timezones and understand the importance of communication.

### What would make me a good Analytics Engineer or BI Developer
Good question! I've been using python for a little over two years ago, but I really got into it after quarantine started. I also took some probability and statistics classes while studying at UT. I used those skills to get accepted into an online data science bootcamp which I'm finishing up now!

My resume can tell you more about this or you can also check out my [Github](https://github.com/Bench-amblee?tab=repositories) to see what I've been working on. 

I can confidently work on any project that involves
- Python, including libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, streamlit, and seaborn
- Machine Learning models with scikit-learn including regression, correlation, random forest, gradient boosting, etc.
- HTML/CSS (and markdown files to like the one you're reading now)
- SQL, MySQL Server, SQLite
- Excel and Google Sheets
- Tableau
- Git/Github  

And I can pick up skills that I'm not familiar with like using the Hubspot API or anything else that might come up. I'm learning more about Data Science every day and would love to take on new challenges!

### I have plenty of experience working with marketing analytics and using data to make decisions
I worked at a digital marketing startup in Austin where we supported a lot of independent businesses using analytics.
Whether it was to engage with their clients more on social media or to post more frequently, the rest of the team and I helped a lot of businesses succeed just by interpreting data, answering questions, and solving problems. 
## I'd love to do the same at Lumen Learning
If you've gotten this far, thank you so much for reading through this whole letter! I'd love to talk more about the goals for this position and how I can help achieve them!        

Thank you again, I hope to hear from you soon!
