## Hello!

### My name is Ben    
This is my cover letter for Lumen Learning, a company that I would absolutely love to work at! Your mission of enabling unprecedented learning for all students is one that really resonates with me.

As someone who spent their last semester of college "learning" through Zoom lectures and take-home-tests, I know what it's like to not have the best classroom experience. Lumen's resources for teachers and students are a great way to improve this experience, I'd love to help get these resources to teachers and students all over to make sure the learning experience is a positive one for everyone.

### What would make me a good python developer or data analyst?
Good question! I've been using python for a little over two years ago, but I really got into it after quarantine started. I also took some probability and statistics classes while studying at UT. I used those skills to get accepted into an online data science bootcamp which I'm finishing up now!

My resume can tell you more about this or you can also check out my [Github](https://github.com/Bench-amblee?tab=repositories) to see what I've been working on. 

I can confidently work on any project that involves
- Python, including libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, streamlit, and seaborn
- Machine Learning models with scikit-learn including regression, correlation, random forest, gradient boosting, etc.
- HTML/CSS (and markdown files to like the one you're reading now)
- SQL, MySQL Server, SQLite
- Excel and Google Sheets
- Tableau
- Git/Github  

And I can pick up skills that I'm not familiar with like using the Hubspot API or anything else that might come up. I'm learning more about Data Science every day and would love to take on new challenges!

### I have plenty of experience working with marketing analytics and using data to make decisions
I worked at a digital marketing startup in Austin where we supported a lot of independent businesses using analytics.
Whether it was to engage with their clients more on social media or to post more frequently, the rest of the team and I helped a lot of businesses succeed just by interpreting data, answering questions, and solving problems. 
## I'd love to do the same at Lumen Learning
If you've gotten this far, thank you so much for reading through this whole letter! I'd love to talk more about the goals for this position and how I can help achieve them!        

Thank you again, I hope to hear from you soon!
